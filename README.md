## Welcome!

Welcome to Brunel: the full-scale, steam-powered, modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2!
The world is set for a steampunk themed adventure with huge machines, huge
logomotives, huge steamships, and dirigibles!

Dangerous creatures have been banished to dark caves and other dimensions, but
we don't want things to get too easy, so we've included realistic seasons,
healing and hunger:

* [Serene Seasons](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/serene-seasons)
* [Spice of Life](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-spice-of-life)

However, the world itself is a wholesome place, filled with lusious trees,
food, and materials to build with:

* [Pam's HarvestCraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pams-harvestcraft)

And, not least of all, for those who yearn for magic and mayhem, just construct
a magic portal to find dungeons, daemons, liches, and giant monsters:

And this is just the short list! Scroll to the bottom of the page for the full
list of mods available in this pack.

## Server Rules

Brunel is a cooperative multi-player server where we all try to help one
another, and leave room for everyone's individual creations. As such, we have
some basic ground rules:

* No uninvited player vs. player combat.
* Do not disturb anything which appears
  to have been made by another player.
* Do not build anything within sight of
  another player's constructions without
  talking it over with them first.
* Make it easy for others to figure out
  that you made something.
* Don't tear up the landscape without
  making something better out of it.
