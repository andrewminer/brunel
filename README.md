## Welcome!

Welcome to Brunel: the full-scale,
steam-powered, modpack for Minecraft
1.12.2! The world is set for a steampunk
themed adventure with huge machines,
huge logomotives, huge steamships, and
dirigibles!

* [DaVinci's Vessels](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/davincis-vessels)
* [Immersive Engineering](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-engineering)
* [Immersive Railroading](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/immersive-railroading)
* [ViesCraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/viescraft-airships)

Dangerous creatures have been banished
to dark caves and other dimensions, but
we don't want things to get too easy, so
we've included realistic seasons, healing
and hunger:

* [In Control](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/in-control)
* [First Aid](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/first-aid)
* [Serene Seasons](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/serene-seasons)
* [Spice of Life](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-spice-of-life)

However, the world itself is a wholesome
place, filled with lusious trees, food,
and materials to build with:

* [Agricraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/agricraft)
* [Animania](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/animania)
* [Biomes o'Plenty](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/biomes-o-plenty)
* [Cooking for Blockheads](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cooking-for-blockheads)
* [Dynamic Trees](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dynamictrees)
* [Earthworks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/earthworks)
* [Forestry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forestry)
* [Pam's HarvestCraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pams-harvestcraft)

And, not least of all, for those who
yearn for magic and mayhem, just
construct a magic portal to find
dungeons, daemons, liches, and giant
monsters:

* [NetherEx](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/netherex)
* [Twilight Forest](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-twilight-forest)

And this is just the short list! Scroll
to the bottom of the page for the full
list of mods available in this pack.

## Server Rules

Brunel is a cooperative multi-player
server where we all try to help one
another, and leave room for everyone's
individual creations. As such, we have
some basic ground rules:

* No uninvited player vs. player combat.
* Do not disturb anything which appears
  to have been made by another player.
* Do not build anything within sight of
  another player's constructions without
  talking it over with them first.
* Make it easy for others to figure out
  that you made something.
* Don't tear up the landscape without
  making something better out of it.

## Technological Considerations

This modpack can be pretty taxing on your computer what with having a good number
of mods, and some of them pretty demanding.  You should make sure to give your
client at least 4GB of RAM for things to work well, and you'll want to adjust your
video settings if you don't have a pretty new video card.

## Credits

This modpack would not exist but for the
efforts of dozens of people over years
of hard work. Please take a moment to
silently acknowledge their efforts, or,
even better go leave a comment on their
project pages!
